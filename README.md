This project is a data-visualization exercise created by Kevin Mooers and Rebecca Corely. The goal of this project is to illustrate fundamental concepts of stellar evolution. 
To this aim, we create a webpage that hosts three visualizations: 
|      | Illustration |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1|   Tree Diagram showing the possible evolutionary tracks of stellar material            |
|     2|   Hertzsprung–Russell diagram showing how temperature and luminosity change as stars age             |
|     3|   A scatterplot allowing users to explore stellar attributes           |

In order to see the visualizations, locally host the index.html file.

The project folders are organized as follows:
* **The root folder** contains index.html, along with the stylesheets and app.js. The app.js file simply points to the underlying javascript files used for each visualization.
* **/d3_tree/** contains all of the data, logic, and images used for the Tree Diagram
* **/d3_hr/** contains all of the data, and logic used for the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram
* **/d3_scatterplot/** contains the logic used for the scatterplot. This scatterplot references the data used in the Hertsprung-Russell diagram
* **/favicon/** holds the image used for the small icon on the web-browser tab
* **/Project Proposal and Process Book/** holds the project proposal and process book
* **/Supplementary Work/** contains scratch-work and side-work that is not part of the main project, but was used during development

We hope you enjoy the project!
