These interstellar clouds consist of a mix of gas, dust, and plasma. Regions of molecular clouds that collapse under the force of gravity begin to produce any number of stellar objects from tiny planets to giant stars.",

An open cluster is a star cluster composed of tens of thousands of stars. These stars form from the same molecular cloud and are roughly the same age. The stars here are protostars, very young stars that are still accumulating mass from the molecular cloud. Pictured here is one of the most famous open clusters: the <i>Pleiades Cluster</i>, also known as the seven sisters.",
